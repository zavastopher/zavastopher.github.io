                    <p>
                        Hello there, I am <b>Christopher Zavala</b> but you can call me <b>Chris</b>. I am a software
                        developer
                        with a degree in computer science from <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina State
                            University</a>. I created this website in order to demonstrate my web-development skills and
                        to
                        experiment with layout and javascript.
                        My programming
                        interests include the following:

                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Overview</h3>
                        I am most familiar with <b>Python</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>Javascript</b>, <b>HTML</b> and
                        <b>CSS</b> as
                        I
                        have made the most amount of projects with those languages. The others I have built atleast one
                        project
                        using said language.<br>

                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Python</h3>
                        I have made mostly
                        CLI tools with <b>Python</b> including a Music Composition program. This program simulated
                        an RPG Dungeon with a hero character and monsters using Dungeons and Dragons style rules and
                        mapped
                        the resulting simulation to
                        MIDI output that I used to compose a music piece.<br>

                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Java</h3>
                        As for
                        <b>Java</b>
                        my experience largely lies in a semester long datastructures project, a coffee inventory and
                        order
                        management
                        full-stack web application, and a course management application. The course management
                        application
                        got
                        me familiar with test driven and object oriented development while the datastructures project
                        got me
                        familiar
                        with algorithm focused development. Finally the coffee shop management project got me familiar
                        with
                        software
                        development practices including documentation, teamwork, deployment, and much more.<br>

                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Javascript HTML CSS</h3>
                        <b>Javascript</b>, <b>HTML</b>,
                        and <b>CSS</b> are languages that I have used to develop several full-stack applications
                        including a
                        movie database like IMDB, a web-scraper, a black-jack website, and this
                        website.
                        I also have quite a bit of experience with C as I took two courses that focused on C
                        programming, one
                        focused on learning C and one focused on operating systems, but because I have more experience
                        with the
                        previously mentioned languages.

                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Overview</h3>
                        For programming I am comfortable using several different tools as listed above. This
                        is not necessarily an exhuastive list of tools I use but instead a list of tools that
                        I use most of the time when working on development projects.<br>
                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Vim</h3>
                        When I need to make quick edits or I am ssh'ed into a remote machine I am comfortable using
                        Vim. Once I got past the initial learning curve I have enjoyed it very much as a simple text
                        editor
                        that allowed for fast edits. I am still not a level where it can replace an IDE like
                        VS-Code for me but I am interested in getting to that point.<br>

                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">VS-Code/Codium</h3>
                        VS-Code is the first IDE/Editor that I used for programming outside of the
                        assigned Eclipse IDE that we were expected to use in Java courses at NCSU.
                        I liked it's extensibility as I could add plugins to allow for testing and live
                        previews of my projects. I have recently started using Codium in place of VS-Code
                        for various reasons.<br>

                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Git Version Control</h3>
                        Git version control is something that I have been working since the beginning of my
                        programming career at state. It has become integral to my development process as
                        it has for many others. I use it not only for development projects but also for "syncing"
                        my notes across my laptop and desktop.<br>

                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Google Suite</h3>
                        The google suite has all but dominated my document authoring experience. From
                        high-school to now I have used google docs to make word documents, slides,
                        spreadsheets, and to store files in the cloud. I am also familiar with Microsoft
                        Office and Libre-office suites aswell.<br>

                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Eclipse</h3>
                        Eclipse was the default IDE that was required in virtually every class at NCSU that
                        focused on Java development. I have installed it several times on several different
                        computers including several laptops with linux-based operating systems on them. I
                        have spent a lot of time in this IDE even though it is not my prefered editor.

                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Overview</h3>
                        While this category is labeled frameworks I understand that not all of the
                        technologies listed are considered frameworks. In this case I am mostly just
                        listing off tools that aren't quite as broad as an Editor or Language. For
                        example the Python Flask Library.<br>

                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">NodeJS</h3>
                        For all but one of my full-stack development projects I have used Node-JS to
                        run server-side javascript. This includes two team projects and several smaller
                        individual projects. This includes setting up package jsons required for deployment.
                        These projects included a black jack pwa and movie database web-app.
                        <br>
                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">NextJS</h3>
                        This javascript framework was mostly used in my senior design project as
                        my teammates chose it as the framework they wanted to work with. I ended up using
                        it to develop a landing page for our project.

                        <br>
                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Python Flask</h3>
                        Python flask is a library that we used in my senior design project to
                        run our server code. This was done upon the request of our sponsor who prefers
                        developing his web applications with this backend. I became familiar with it
                        as I had to write our database ORM scripts for the server to properly interact
                        with the MySQL database we created.

                        <br>
                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">AngularJS</h3>
                        AngularJS was the framework that was chosen by the teaching staff in my software
                        development course that focused on the engineering process behind developing full
                        applications. It was used to help us develop the frontend of the Coffee inventory
                        and order management app that was assigned as the project.

                        <br>
                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">MySQL</h3>
                        I used MySQL in both my senior design course and a databases course that I took.
                        During the databases course it was used to teach us the basic concepts of relational
                        databases and for developing our own database application, in my case my group
                        decided on a movie database.

                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Linux</h3>
                        Personally I have been using linux on and off since I was in middle school, roughly around 2012,
                        and have had basically the full spectrum of experience with it. When I first used a linux distro
                        it was a laptop that had a currupted windows install that Ubuntu replaced. I got used to using
                        the
                        terminal in the most basic sense, mostly copy pasting code to run minecraft servers. Eventually
                        I replaced the bulky laptop with a school provided chromebook and didn't return to linux until
                        my first C class at NCSU. The testing environment for the assignments was linux and thus we were
                        expected to use a linux environment to work on our assignments, or atleast test them. I decided
                        that
                        instead of WSL I was going to install linux on my laptop because of that and got familiar with
                        Linux
                        on a deeper level this go round. I learned how to navigate folders, manage programs, and even
                        modified
                        some bash scripts to help with screen tearing I was experiencing. This time with an, at the
                        time,
                        Ubuntu based distro Pop-OS. I then got familiar with the low-level aspects of linux through the
                        OS
                        class I took. Now I have Fedora installed on my laptop and used it as my primary development

                        <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Windows</h3>
                        Windows has been an operating system that has been my default for most of my time using a
                        computer.
                        In my personal life many of my hobbies involve programs that only work on Windows and as a
                        result it
                        has been the primary OS on my personal machine. I do end up working on development projects on
                        said
                        machine so I have learned how to get Windows to work as a development environment. I used WSL to
                        run programs I wrote on my Linux laptop whenever the need arose. I personally have been using it
                        more
                        for development lately as I have had less of a need to develop on my laptop. I prefer using
                        git-bash
                        as my terminal on windows because it allows me to use unix-like commands as opposed to the
                        windows
                        cmd line or powershell.

                    It has been roughly 2 months since my last blog post and since then there have been some changes
                    since then.
                    First of all, welcome to the my new portfolio website. This was a project meant to demonstrate my
                    ability to
                    develop a standalone website and to demonstrate my ability to develop a project on my own. Grasnted
                    this
                    website is pretty simple. I used the bulma component library to experiment with their compenents and
                    found
                    they were useful. I also wrote some javascript to help out with page navigation in order to make
                    this a single
                    page app. I am still looking for work and if you are potential employer considering me for work I
                    would love
                    to hear from you at the email listed under the contacts-page.<br>

                    First off, HAPPY NEW YEAR. I am looking forward to this year and getting to explore my interests in
                    computer science on my own. Particularly I look forward to joining a professional team and working
                    on learning Game development on my own. This includes following some tutorials for Godot and joining
                    a game jam during January. I hope to produce some projects that I am proud of. I am also applying to
                    various companies to see if I can join their teams and start my professional career in computer
                    science outside of academia. I am currently working on updating my portfolio to include projects
                    from school that I am allowed to share in my portfolio.

                <div class="blog-body is-hidden">
                    <hr>
                    It is now the beginning of the second half of the 2023 fall semester and my graduation is on the
                    horizon. My projects have been going well and I have been keeping my head above water. This semester
                    is a heavy workload meant to allow for my graduation in december but that also means that I have had
                    little to no time to update this repo and most of my projects that I am working on are not quite at
                    the state that I can confidently push them to this repository, so in their stead this update will
                    serve as a log of my progress so far.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Senior design:</b>
                    I am currently taking the senior design course at NCSU. I was assigned to a group working on a
                    project involving CRUD, User Account Management, Web Scraping, Client-Server project implementation,
                    and task brockering.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Web-Development:</b>
                    I am also taking a web-development class focusing on client-server computing. I have developed
                    several smaller projects used to demonstrate basic web-development skills such as HTML, CSS, DOM
                    object manipulation in JS, Node-JS, API implementation, Client side and Server side rendering,
                    Docker deployment, Session cookie management, and much more. I am also working on a semester long
                    group project focusing on implementing all of these skills.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Databases:</b>
                    I have also been learning about database management with a focus on MySQL as the core technology
                    used during the course. I have learned a lot about Normalization, Database insertions, Table
                    creation, and SQL Connection libraries. I am also about to start yet another project, this one
                    focusing on designing and implementing a database
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Social-Computing and Decentralized AI:</b>
                    This course has been focused mainly on the theory behind Social-Computing and Decentralized AI.
                    Learning about how agents interact, how contracts can be violated w/ out technically violating them,
                    and how to properly motivate user agents without violating concepts such as autonomy.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Computer Music Composition:</b>
                    And finally we get to a course that has been great for making me consider new ways of thinking and
                    widening my perspective. This course has taught me how to combine one of my biggest hobbies and the
                    field I have dedicated myself to. Learning about the history of algorithmic compisition and
                    synthesis. I am now also embarking on a journey to produce my own piece using said techniques. As of
                    right now I am looking into simulating a simple rouguelike dungeon game in python and using the
                    output to compose a piece using midi.

                <h1 class="title is-3">08-2023 | Creation of my portfolio repository</h1>
                <div class="blog-body is-hidden">
                    <hr>
                    I created this repository to host my portfolio projects in order to keep track of and demonstrate my
                    skills as a developer. I am fully aware I should have done this earlier and excuses do not fix that
                    issue, that being said here are some of the reasons I have for not doing so earlier in order to
                    reassure some doubts as to why a senior in a CSC program took so long to set up a personal
                    portfolio.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>1. Time:</b> during my first few years of schooling I was still going back to my hometown during
                    the summers. During this time that I could have started developing a portfolio I worked 5 days a
                    week at an internship and then spent my weekends working with my parents in the service industry.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>2. Awareness:</b> I will admit I should have been more aware of what the differenece between
                    software development and computer science was, unfortunately due to a lack of resources growing up
                    and lack of awareness I did not and that has led to my "late" start.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>3. Knowing Where To Start:</b> The internet is amazing in providing resources to learn how to
                    grow as a developer and learning new technologies. What it isn't great at is guiding people who are
                    naive. Sure, there are those who have great courses out there for guiding newbie developers but most
                    of the time the kind of guidance I needed was the kind a mentor would have provided but I didn't
                    know who to ask, what to ask of them, or even that I needed to ask someone to guide me in the first
                    place.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>4. Laziness:</b> This one is a hard pill to swallow. No one likes to think of themselves as lazy,
                    especially in a field where grinding out long hours on development projects is a badge of honor, but
                    if I am being honest with my self this has set me back. Now I'm not saying that I was sitting around
                    staring at a wall. What ended up happening was that when I finally was able to have a summer where I
                    could have focused on working on my portfolio it was also the first summer since I was a child that
                    I was not working 7-days a week. -Side Note: while this might seem like an exageration I assure you
                    it is not. The town that I grew up in was a tourist town with no secondary industry to rely on,
                    therefore it was necessary to work as much as possible during the tourist season and use the money
                    earned during that time to hold you over till the start of the next season, now back to the point.-
                    As a result I did not know how to properly relax, I overdid it and ended up wasting my time
                    overindulging in hobbies and sleeping. This led to massive amounts of guilt during the school year
                    and one thing led to another leading to a severe mental health decline that dramatically tanked my
                    scholastic performance as well.
                    <br><br>
                    With all of these things considered I am now in a place where I can finally start taking the steps
                    to start honing my skills. I have learned a lot at my time at NCSU but it is now up to me to
                    demonstrate these skills, hence the creation of this repo.
