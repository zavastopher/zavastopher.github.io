                        Hello there, I am <b>Christopher Zavala</b> but you can call me <b>Chris</b>. I am a software developer
                        with a degree in computer science from <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina State
                            University</a>. I created this website in order to demonstrate my web-development skills and to 
                            experiment with layout and javascript.
                        My programming
                        interests include the following:

                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Overview</h3>
                            I am most familiar with <b>Python</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>Javascript</b>, <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> as
                            I
                            have made the most amount of projects with those languages. The others I have built atleast one project
                            using said language.<br>
                            
                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Python</h3>
                            I have made mostly
                            CLI tools with <b>Python</b> including a Music Composition program. This program simulated
                            an RPG Dungeon with a hero character and monsters using Dungeons and Dragons style rules and mapped
                            the resulting simulation to
                            MIDI output that I used to compose a music piece. More about it in this <a>post</a>. <br>
                            
                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Java</h3>
                            As for
                            <b>Java</b>
                            my experience largely lies in a semester long datastructures project, a coffee inventory and order
                            management
                            full-stack web application, and a course management application. The course management application
                            got
                            me familiar with test driven and object oriented development while the datastructures project got me
                            familiar
                            with algorithm focused development. Finally the coffee shop management project got me familiar with
                            software
                            development practices including documentation, teamwork, deployment, and much more.<br>

                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Javascript HTML CSS</h3>
                            <b>Javascript</b>, <b>HTML</b>,
                            and <b>CSS</b> are languages that I have used to develop several full-stack applications including a
                            <a>movie database</a> like IMDB, a <a>web-scraper</a>, a <a>black-jack</a> website, and this website.
                            I also have quite a bit of experience with C as I took two courses that focused on C programming, one
                            focused on learning C and one focused on operating systems, but because I have more experience with the 
                            previously mentioned languages.

                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Overview</h3>
                            For programming I am comfortable using several different tools as listed above. This 
                            is not necessarily an exhuastive list of tools I use but instead a list of tools that 
                            I use most of the time when working on development projects.<br>
                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Vim</h3>
                            When I need to make quick edits or I am ssh'ed into a remote machine I am comfortable using
                            Vim. Once I got past the initial learning curve I have enjoyed it very much as a simple text editor
                            that allowed for fast edits. I am still not a level where it can replace an IDE like
                            VS-Code for me but I am interested in getting to that point.<br>

                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">VS-Code/Codium</h3>
                            VS-Code is the first IDE/Editor that I used for programming outside of the 
                            assigned Eclipse IDE that we were expected to use in Java courses at NCSU.
                            I liked it's extensibility as I could add plugins to allow for testing and live
                            previews of my projects. I have recently started using Codium in place of VS-Code
                            for various reasons.<br>

                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Git Version Control</h3>
                            Git version control is something that I have been working since the beginning of my
                            programming career at state. It has become integral to my development process as 
                            it has for many others. I use it not only for development projects but also for "syncing"
                            my notes across my laptop and desktop.<br>

                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Google Suite</h3>
                            The google suite has all but dominated my document authoring experience. From 
                            high-school to now I have used google docs to make word documents, slides, 
                            spreadsheets, and to store files in the cloud. I am also familiar with Microsoft
                            Office and Libre-office suites aswell.<br>

                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Eclipse</h3>
                            Eclipse was the default IDE that was required in virtually every class at NCSU that
                            focused on Java development. I have installed it several times on several different
                            computers including several laptops with linux-based operating systems on them. I 
                            have spent a lot of time in this IDE even though it is not my prefered editor.

                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Overview</h3>
                            While this category is labeled frameworks I understand that not all of the 
                            technologies listed are considered frameworks. In this case I am mostly just
                            listing off tools that aren't quite as broad as an Editor or Language. For
                            example the Python Flask Library.<br>

                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">NodeJS</h3>
                            For all but one of my full-stack development projects I have used Node-JS to
                            run server-side javascript. This includes two team projects and several smaller
                            individual projects. This includes setting up package jsons required for deployment.
                            These projects included a <a>black jack</a> pwa and <a>movie database</a> web-app.
                            <br>
                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">NextJS</h3>
                            This javascript framework was mostly used in my <a>senior design project</a> as 
                            my teammates chose it as the framework they wanted to work with. I ended up using 
                            it to develop a landing page for our project.

                            <br>
                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Python Flask</h3>
                            Python flask is a library that we used in my <a>senior design project</a> to
                            run our server code. This was done upon the request of our sponsor who prefers
                            developing his web applications with this backend. I became familiar with it
                            as I had to write our database ORM scripts for the server to properly interact
                            with the MySQL database we created.

                            <br>
                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">AngularJS</h3>
                            AngularJS was the framework that was chosen by the teaching staff in my software
                            development course that focused on the engineering process behind developing full
                            applications. It was used to help us develop the frontend of the Coffee inventory
                            and order management app that was assigned as the project.

                            <br>
                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">MySQL</h3>
                            I used MySQL in both my senior design course and a databases course that I took.
                            During the databases course it was used to teach us the basic concepts of relational
                            databases and for developing our own database application, in my case my group
                            decided on a movie database.

                            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-4">Linux</h3>
                            Personally I have been using linux on and off since I was in middle school, roughly around 2012,
                            and have had basically the full spectrum of experience with it. When I first used a linux distro
                            it was a laptop that had a currupted windows install that Ubuntu replaced. I got used to using the 
                            terminal in the most basic sense, mostly copy pasting code to run minecraft servers. Eventually
                            I replaced the bulky laptop with a school provided chromebook and didn't return to linux until
                            my first C class at NCSU. The testing environment for the assignments was linux and thus we were
                            expected to use a linux environment to work on our assignments, or atleast test them. I decided that
                            instead of WSL I was going to install linux on my laptop because of that and got familiar with Linux
                            on a deeper level this go round. I learned how to navigate folders, manage programs, and even modified
                            some bash scripts to help with screen tearing I was experiencing. This time with an, at the time,
                            Ubuntu based distro Pop-OS. I then got familiar with the low-level aspects of linux through the OS
                            class I took. Now I have Fedora installed on my laptop and used it as my primary development machine
                            during my last semester at NCSU.

                            Windows has been an operating system that has been my default for most of my time using a computer. 
                            In my personal life many of my hobbies involve programs that only work on Windows and as a result it
                            has been the primary OS on my personal machine. I do end up working on development projects on said 
                            machine so I have learned how to get Windows to work as a development environment. I used WSL to 
                            run programs I wrote on my Linux laptop whenever the need arose. I personally have been using it more
                            for development lately as I have had less of a need to develop on my laptop. I prefer using git-bash 
                            as my terminal on windows because it allows me to use unix-like commands as opposed to the windows
                            cmd line or powershell.
